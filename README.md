# Dev-Tools
## Developer Tools I have played around with:
* [Ijeawele Browser Extension](https://github.com/viclotana/Ijeawele)

A Browser Extension that displays a random suggestion from the Dear Ijeawele book by Chimamnda Adichie
* [Bitkoin Converter Extension](https://github.com/viclotana/bitkoin)

A Browser Extension that shows the current rate of Bitcoin in Naira On-Click in Real-Time
